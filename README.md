`main` now develops `0.4.0.dev0`. Install the immutable `v0.3.0` tag for the
current stable release; new development features are labeled separately.

Ordin is a Python library and CLI for developers and AI agents. It examines a
proposed action, identifies effects such as file deletion or network access,
and returns `allow`, `warn`, `ask`, or `block` with reasons. You can also describe
a task in plain language to find a shell command for it.

The core runs locally, uses deterministic rules, and has no required runtime
dependencies. It does not send commands, tool arguments, or history to a hosted
service.

## Install and try it

Use Python 3.10–3.13 and Git. The v0.3 line is tested on Linux and macOS;
command knowledge remains Linux-first where platform metadata says so.

The current stable release is `v0.3.0`, including Codex, MCP HTTP, live sessions,
contract pinning and private capture. Use its tag or verified wheel for a
repeatable installation; `main` is the development branch.

Install the stable release in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/LatentOps/ordin.git@v0.3.0"
ordin doctor
```

Review a command:

```bash
ordin check "git status --short"
```

```text
decision: allow
risk: low
- reads source-control state (git status)
```

`check` reviews the quoted command without executing it. `doctor` validates
Ordin's local command data and schemas.

<details>
<summary>Install the development branch instead</summary>

To try unreleased changes, install `main`:

```bash
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/LatentOps/ordin.git"
```

Development builds can change between installs. Use the version tag for a
repeatable release installation.

</details>

The [v0.3.0 release](https://github.com/LatentOps/ordin/releases/tag/v0.3.0) also
provides a wheel, source archive and integrity metadata. Read the
[release notes](docs/releases/v0.3.0.md) for changes since v0.2.0.

See [installation](docs/installation.md) for other install options and optional
semantic search dependencies.

Start with the [offline v0.3 quickstart](docs/quickstart.md).
Its wheel-based acceptance script verifies every maintained integration with
local fixtures and no model or credential requirement. The [v0.3 release notes](docs/releases/v0.3.0.md)
record compatibility changes and limitations.

## Find a command

Describe what you want to do:

```bash
ordin what is using port 3000 --limit 1
ordin find files larger than 1gb
ordin search "lookup dns for example.com" --limit 3
```

For the port query, Ordin suggests `lsof -i :3000`. Results include the command's
purpose, examples, risk, and local availability. Ordin prints suggestions; you
choose whether to run them.

Search uses BM25 lexical ranking over curated command cards. The optional
[semantic reranker](docs/semantic-reranking.md) works with an explicitly supplied
local model and does not download one automatically.

## Understand and enforce a decision

The CLI is advisory by default: a completed review exits successfully even when
its decision is `warn`, `ask`, or `block`. Use `--enforce` when a script or CI job
needs a failing exit status:

```bash
ordin check "git status --short" --json --enforce
```

| Decision | What it means | Default `AgentGate` result | Exit with `--enforce` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allow` | Recognized behavior with no stronger finding | `execute` | `0` |
| `warn` | Known behavior with elevated risk | `escalate` | `10` |
| `ask` | Unknown semantics or an approval requirement | `escalate` | `20` |
| `block` | A critical condition or explicit blocking policy | `deny` | `30` |

Invalid CLI input returns `2`. An explicit `--fail-on` threshold changes which
decisions cause a nonzero exit. See [enforcement and exit codes](docs/enforcement.md)
for threshold examples and the full exit-code contract.

Provide intent and execution context when they matter:

```bash
ordin review \
  --command "git status --short" \
  --intent "inspect repository state" \
  --cwd "$PWD" \
  --repo-root "$PWD" \
  --json
```

Reviews can combine shell parsing, command semantics, resource paths, local
policy, and bounded action history. Unknown behavior remains uncertain.
Caller-supplied policies can strengthen a decision but cannot weaken a stronger
core finding.

## Use Ordin from Python

`AgentGate` translates a review into a runtime decision:

```python
from ordin import AgentGate

decision = AgentGate().evaluate(
    "git status --short",
    intent="inspect repository state",
)

print(decision.disposition)  # execute
print(decision.may_execute)  # True
```

Your runtime should execute the proposed action only when `may_execute` is true.
It handles approval when `requires_approval` is true and rejects a denied action.
The gate itself never runs the command.

For generic actions, use `ActionEnvelope` and `AgentGate.evaluate_action()`.
`ToolCallAdapter` and `MCPAdapter` preserve tool identity and arguments; trusted
semantics match exact identities. See the [Python API](docs/python-api.md) and
[tool adapters](docs/tool-and-mcp-adapters.md).

## Connect an agent or shell

On the **0.4 development branch**, start with [safe setup](docs/setup.md):

```sh
ordin setup cursor --dry-run
ordin setup cursor
ordin setup smoke cursor
```

Choose `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `mcp`, `mcp-http`, or `shell`.
`ordin setup status` checks configuration; `ordin setup remove cursor` removes an
unchanged owned profile. Review host trust before real use. Existing files are
preserved; the guides below retain manual configuration for v0.3 and advanced use.

| Integration | Entry point | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code hooks | `ordin-claude-hook` | [Hook configuration and supported tools](docs/claude-code-integration.md) |
| Codex hooks | `ordin-codex-hook` | [Hooks and plugin configuration](docs/codex-integration.md) |
| Cursor hooks (0.4 development) | `ordin-cursor-hook` | [Native hooks and host limitations](docs/cursor-integration.md) |
| An MCP client and stdio server | `ordin-mcp-proxy` | [Proxy setup and tool semantics](docs/mcp-safety-proxy.md) |
| An MCP client and HTTP server | `ordin-mcp-http` | [Streamable HTTP setup](docs/mcp-http-proxy.md) |
| Bash or Zsh | `ordin shell-init` and `orun` | [Reviewed shell execution](docs/shell-integration.md) |
| Your own runtime | Python API or JSON CLI | [Runnable integration examples](examples/integrations/README.md) |

The MCP proxy reviews `tools/call` requests before forwarding them to its
configured server. Unknown tools require approval by default. Claude Code hooks
map decisions to the runtime's permission flow and can record post-tool
observations.

From a matching checkout and activated Ordin environment, try these harmless
hook requests before configuring a host:

```bash
ordin-claude-hook pre < examples/claude-code-pre.json
ordin-codex-hook doctor
ordin-codex-hook pre < examples/codex-pre.json
```

For Claude, merge the reviewed `hooks` object from
[`examples/claude-code-settings.json`](examples/claude-code-settings.json) into
the host settings. For Codex, `ordin-codex-hook install ~/.codex/hooks.json`
creates a new hook layer and refuses an existing file; review/trust it in
Codex `/hooks`. The guides explain host permissions and existing-config handling.

MCP onboarding follows `inspect → scaffold → human review → validate → lock →
proxy`. Discovery never grants trusted effects. The quickstart provides a
complete local stdio fixture and an HTTP loopback check.

## Keep session context

One individually ordinary step can become risky after another. A trusted
observation that a read exposed a secret can make a subsequent upload a block.
Maintained integrations use the same bounded action/observation history;
MCP sessions retain it in memory. Claude/Codex persistence is optional and needs
explicit lifecycle hooks and a private state path. Nothing reads a transcript
to invent intent or history. See [live sessions](docs/integration-sessions.md).

## Use a shell wrapper

For a Bash session, enable the shell wrapper explicitly:

```bash
source <(ordin shell-init bash)
orun 'git status --short'
```

`orun` executes a command after its review flow permits it. The MCP proxy launches
the configured server; that server executes its tools.
The integrating runtime remains responsible for credentials, sandboxing, and
approval UI. Ordin does not edit shell startup files automatically.

## JSON, policy, and audit evidence

From a repository checkout, try the versioned example requests:

```bash
ordin review --stdin --json < examples/review.json
ordin action --stdin --json < examples/action.json
ordin policy validate examples/policy.json
ordin action --stdin --policy examples/policy.json --json < examples/action.json
```

Public schemas live in [schemas/](schemas/). The [policy guide](docs/policies.md)
explains action and context selectors; [temporal policies](docs/temporal-policies.md)
cover patterns across multiple actions.

Reviews expose structured provenance and advisory execution-capability profiles.
Local audit persistence is optional and disabled by default. Read
[audit and provenance](docs/audit-and-provenance.md) and
[execution observations](docs/execution-evidence.md) for the evidence contracts
and redaction behavior.

## What the tests establish

CI runs Python 3.10–3.13 and native macOS, validates an isolated wheel, checks
Debian/Fedora installation, and runs safety, trajectory, regression, integration,
quickstart, CodeQL and workflow-security gates.
The [evaluation reports](docs/integration-evaluation.md) separate core review,
adapter handling, and local subprocess overhead. Each records its workloads,
revision, environment, and measurement limits.
The [Agent Safety Corpus v1](docs/agent-safety-corpus.md) adds versioned maintainer-derived
failures and explicit synthetic controls on the 0.4 development branch.

Release-facing measurements are regenerated by the exact-candidate gate;
historical reports are not measurements of a later release. Release artifacts
gain checksums, a build inventory and verified provenance; these identify bytes
and build origin, not proof that source is vulnerability-free.

These checks cover finite fixtures and recognized semantics. An `allow` decision
is not proof that an arbitrary action is safe. Keep execution permissions and
sandbox controls in the runtime, and supply the context and history needed for
the review. Local adapter timing does not measure a complete live-agent session.
