# Ordin

**Know what a shell action will do before it runs.**

Ordin is a local command-intelligence and pre-execution safety engine for developers and AI agents. It can find shell commands from natural-language intent, review proposed commands before execution, and act as a deterministic gate between an agent and its shell runtime.

Core search and safety review are local-first. Ordin does not require a cloud service, upload command history, or execute agent actions on its own.

## Install v0.1.0

The first public release is available from GitHub Releases. PyPI publishing is not enabled yet.

```bash
python -m pip install https://github.com/LatentOps/ordin/releases/download/v0.1.0/ordin-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
ordin doctor
```

For an unreleased checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LatentOps/ordin.git
cd ordin
python -m pip install .
```

See [Installation](docs/installation.md) for development setup and optional semantic reranking.

## Three ways to use Ordin

### 1. Find the command you need

Describe the task instead of remembering the exact Linux command:

```bash
ordin what is using port 3000
ordin find files larger than 1gb
ordin make file runnable
```

Or use the explicit search command:

```bash
ordin search "lookup dns for example.com" --limit 3
```

Ordin uses deterministic lexical retrieval by default and can incorporate local command availability and Linux distribution signals.

### 2. Review a command before you run it

```bash
ordin check "git reset --hard HEAD~1"
```

Example:

```text
decision: warn
risk: high
- changes local source-control state
- can rewrite or discard source-control history
```

For richer review, provide intent and execution context:

```bash
ordin review \
  --intent "remove generated dependencies" \
  --command "rm -rf node_modules" \
  --cwd "$PWD" \
  --repo-root "$PWD" \
  --json
```

Unknown commands are not silently treated as safe.

### 3. Gate an AI agent before shell execution

```python
from ordin import AgentGate

result = AgentGate().evaluate(
    "git status --short",
    intent="inspect repository state",
)

if result.may_execute:
    # Execute through your own sandbox or tool runtime.
    ...
elif result.requires_approval:
    # Ask a human or caller-owned approval service.
    ...
else:
    # Reject the proposed action.
    ...
```

The runtime flow is deliberately small:

```text
agent proposes action
        |
        v
      Ordin
        |
        +--> execute
        +--> escalate
        +--> deny
        |
        v
caller-owned shell / sandbox
```

`AgentGate` never runs the command. The integrating runtime owns execution, sandboxing, approval UI, retries, and trace persistence.

See [Agent runtime integration](docs/agent-integration.md) and [Python API](docs/python-api.md).

## Optional shell gate

Shell integration is explicit and reversible. Ordin does not edit shell startup files automatically.

For Bash:

```bash
source <(ordin shell-init bash)
orun 'git status --short'
orun 'rm -rf ./build'
```

For Zsh:

```zsh
source <(ordin shell-init zsh)
```

`orun` reviews the exact command first and only executes according to the shell integration's review flow. See [Shell integration](docs/shell-integration.md).

## What Ordin evaluates

A command review can combine:

1. shell-aware parsing of compound commands, pipelines, substitutions, groups, and nested shell payloads;
2. semantic analyzers for high-value command families;
3. typed effects such as filesystem deletion, network upload, package installation, source-control mutation, privilege escalation, and container changes;
4. exact rules for dangerous combinations;
5. optional execution context such as working directory, repository boundary, effective UID, shell, and agent identity;
6. bounded recent-action traces for multi-step patterns such as secret read followed by upload or download followed by permission change and execution.

The result uses four review decisions:

| Decision | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `allow` | Known low-risk behavior with no stronger finding. |
| `warn` | Known elevated behavior that should be reviewed. |
| `ask` | Ordin cannot establish enough confidence to treat the action as safe. |
| `block` | A known critical condition was detected. |

Agent integrations can then apply a separate `ReviewPolicy` to decide what proceeds automatically and what requires escalation.

## Machine-readable review

Non-Python runtimes can send a versioned request through stdin:

```bash
cat examples/review.json | ordin review --stdin --json
```

Public payloads use versioned Ordin schemas, for example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "ordin.review_request.v1",
  "command": "git status --short",
  "intent": "inspect repository state",
  "context": null,
  "trace": null
}
```

Schemas live in [`schemas/`](schemas/) and are validated by `ordin doctor` and CI.

## Command intelligence

Search is deterministic by default. Ordin combines BM25-style lexical scoring with intent, aliases, examples, templates, command availability, and Linux distribution compatibility.

```bash
ordin search "find large files" --json
ordin explain find
ordin packs
```

An optional local semantic reranker can reorder only a bounded deterministic candidate set. It is not part of the default dependency set and Ordin does not automatically download a model.

```bash
python -m pip install "ordin[semantic]"
```

See [Deterministic ranking](docs/deterministic-ranking.md), [Availability and platforms](docs/availability-and-platforms.md), and [Semantic reranking](docs/semantic-reranking.md).

## Typed effect graph

Curated command metadata can express:

```text
intent -> command
command -> subcommand
command/subcommand -> flag
command/subcommand/flag -> effect
effect -> resource
command -> safer alternative
command -> required privilege
```

The graph is built locally in memory and does not require a graph database.

```bash
ordin graph
ordin graph --json
```

See [Effect graph](docs/effect-graph.md) and [Schema contracts](docs/schema-contracts.md).

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest -q
```

The shared pre-commit gate covers Ruff lint and formatting, staged mypy checks, compilation, `ordin doctor`, and repository namespace integrity. Pull requests additionally run Python 3.10 through 3.13, built-wheel validation, and isolated Debian/Fedora installation smoke tests.

## Design boundaries

Ordin intentionally does not:

- execute commands received through the Python API or `review --stdin`;
- become a general agent framework;
- require a hosted service for core behavior;
- upload shell history or command text;
- generate arbitrary shell programs from free-form prompts;
- treat unclassified behavior as safe.
