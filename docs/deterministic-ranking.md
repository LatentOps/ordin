# Deterministic Search Ranking

CommandGraph uses a deterministic BM25-style lexical ranker for intent-to-command retrieval. The ranker remains local and dependency-free.

## Ranking Signals

The default search score combines:

1. BM25 lexical relevance over command-card text;
2. exact and near intent matches;
3. intent-token overlap;
4. alias overlap;
5. explicit command-name matches;
6. the bounded local availability/platform signal.

The BM25 component uses command-card document length normalization so commands with many examples or aliases do not receive an unlimited advantage merely because they contain more repeated words.

Synonym-expanded terms retain lower query weight than literal query terms.

## Explainability

The human-readable `why` field identifies the principal signals, including the BM25 lexical contribution, intent/alias evidence, matched terms, and availability/platform evidence.

This is intentionally not a learned black-box ranker.

## Legacy Baseline

The previous weighted-IDF scorer remains available internally as `search_legacy()` for deterministic benchmark comparison. It is not a second user-facing search mode.

The checked-in search-quality benchmark evaluates both rankers under the same injected environment. CI requires the default BM25 ranker to:

- satisfy all fixture-level requirements;
- preserve or improve Recall@K;
- preserve or improve Top-1 accuracy;
- preserve or improve mean reciprocal rank.

This gives later retrieval work a stable baseline rather than relying on anecdotal CLI examples.

## Parameters

The current BM25 constants are checked into `commandgraph.search`:

- `k1 = 1.4`
- `b = 0.72`
- a fixed lexical scale used only to keep BM25 contribution comparable to the existing explicit feature boosts.

Parameter changes should be justified by the benchmark rather than tuned to one query.

## Later Semantic Reranking

Optional semantic reranking is intentionally separate. The deterministic ranker remains the default retrieval path and must continue to work without model downloads, hosted APIs, or network access.
